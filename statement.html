                        <p>My professional life has been spent in a variety of occupations, the longest being in a
                            laboratory working with patients, not programming.
                            I have dedicated myself to a whole new career path by attending the full-stack development
                            program offered by
                            <a href="https://bootcamp.extension.ucsd.edu/coding/">UCSD Extension</a>. Although my skills
                            are far from mastered I know I will be
                            a valuable addition to any team. I am dedicated to every job I choose and enjoy the
                            challenges. I have great people skills, a natural leadership quality when
                            needed and I will get the work done and done well. </a>
